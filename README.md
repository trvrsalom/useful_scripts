#useful_scripts
A collection of useful_scripts that I like to have wherever I go.

*Be sure to run authorize.sh first*

####authorize.sh
Automagically give read, write, and execute permissions to all the scripts. Also copies them into a ~/.scripts directory and adds the path variable to .bashrc/.bash_profile
######Usage:
`chmod +x authorize.sh`

`./authorize.sh`

####jcomp.sh
Compile & run a .java file. Automatically removes the .class files. Be sure to not include the .java extension when using this script.
######Usage:
`jcomp.sh yourjavafilename`
